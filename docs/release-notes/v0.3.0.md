This release introduces significant quality and workflow improvements to the `gza` command-line tool, including enhanced type checking with mypy configuration, expanded Claude Code skill capabilities, improved command-line interfaces with additional filtering and output options, and various robustness improvements to the core task management system.

## Features

- **Add `gza cleanup` command** - New command to clean up worktrees and archived log files
- **Add `gza checkout` command** - Remove active worktree (if clean) before checking out task's branch
- **Add `--type` filter to `gza history` command** - Filter task history by task type
- **Add `--status` filter to `gza history` command** - Filter task history by task status
- **Add `--limit` and `--all` flags to `gza history` command** - Control number of results displayed
- **Add `--open` flag to `gza review` command** - Auto-open review files in default editor
- **Add `--mark-only` flag to `gza merge` command** - Mark task as merged without performing actual merge
- **Add support for multiple task IDs in `gza merge` command** - Merge multiple tasks at once
- **Add `--prompt-file` argument to `gza add` command** - Load task prompt from a file
- **Add `gza rebase` command** - Public command for interactive rebasing with conflict resolution
- **Rename `docs-review` skill** - Renamed from `review-docs` for consistency with naming conventions
- **Expand `docs-review` skill with Part 2: Spec Review section** - Enhanced documentation review capabilities
- **Add comprehensive auto-resolve feature for rebasing** - Specs document describing auto-resolve functionality (specs/rebase-resolve.md)

- **Unify `--run` flag across all commands** - Consistent auto-run behavior for `gza work`, `gza retry`, and `gza review`
- **When creating worktrees for new tasks, use local main** - Avoid remote main reference issues
- **Update `gza clean` command to archive files instead of deleting** - Safer cleanup with preserved archives
- **Save WIP changes on KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C)** - Prevent work loss when interrupting tasks
- **Save WIP changes on task failure/interruption** - Automatic save of in-progress work on errors
- **Show review status in `gza unmerged` output** - Display which tasks have pending reviews
- **After `gza work` completes, log summary message** - Show helpful next steps including `gza merge` command
- **Narrow exception handling in `skills_utils.py`** - More specific error handling instead of broad catches
