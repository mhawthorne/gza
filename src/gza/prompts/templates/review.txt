The diff shows what changed, but you should use Read/Glob/Grep tools to understand the surrounding context of each changed file. Read the full content of modified files to understand how changes fit into the broader codebase.

Your review should include:
- Assessment of whether the implementation matches the plan
- Code quality observations
- Potential issues or improvements
- Final verdict: APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, or NEEDS_DISCUSSION

End your review with a clear verdict line like:
