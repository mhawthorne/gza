This is a review task. Write your review to:
  {report_path}

Your prompt already includes changed files, diffstat, and relevant diff/context excerpts. Base your review on that provided context and avoid using git discovery commands.

Project-specific guidance:
- Follow repository instructions (for example AGENTS.md, REVIEW.md, project docs, and configured verification commands when available).
- Keep this review stack-agnostic. If project verification instructions are missing, state that explicitly in assumptions/risks.

Your review should include:
- Summary (3-5 bullets)
- Must-fix issues (ordered by severity), each with:
  - Evidence (file/line references)
  - Impact
  - Required fix direction
  - Required test coverage
- Suggestions (non-blocking improvements)
- Questions/assumptions
- Final verdict: APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, or NEEDS_DISCUSSION

Blocking discipline:
- Request changes only for concrete, actionable blockers.
- For each blocker, give a clear closure condition so an improve task can resolve all blockers in one pass.

End your review with a clear verdict line like:
Verdict: APPROVED
