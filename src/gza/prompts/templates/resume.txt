IMPORTANT: Before continuing, verify your todo list against the actual state of the files.

The task was interrupted (max turns, timeout, etc.) and your todo list may show steps as in_progress that were never actually completed. Please:

1. Review your todo list from the previous session
2. For each item marked as in_progress or completed, verify by checking the actual code/files
3. Update the todo list to reflect what is actually complete vs incomplete
4. Mark any steps that weren't actually finished as pending before continuing

Once you've verified and updated the todo list, continue from where you left off.
